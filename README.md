# The Team Generator Project

## Description 
The objective for this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a team, and with that information generates an HTML webpage that displays the user input data. In addition to building the application, this project also required the use of Jest and Inquirer to conduct unit tests of every part of the code to ensure that it would pass each test. Please enjoy the application and hope it adds functional use to your teams production.
